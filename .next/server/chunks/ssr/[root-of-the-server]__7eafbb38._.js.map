When I’m not going by the name v1ris, my name is Anna Iris\n                  Hill. I’m Canadian born, grew up in New England, and am\n                  currently based in Hartford, Connecticut.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                  I wear a lot of hats, but my big ones are as a composer/music\n                  producer/songwriter and violinist/vocalist. My latest solo\n                  work is a story-driven pop concept album. Go to digital\n                  connection linktree (maybe make a custom one thats a link on\n                  my website). I also play guitar, bass, and keyboard.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                  Besides music, I’m a writer, and am the narrative designer of\n                  the same game I’m the composer for, Rope Tool. I code as a\n                  hobby and have made games in Unity and Gamemaker, and I have\n                  experience implementing music in them both directly and\n                  through middleware such as FMOD and Wwise.\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </CardContent>\n      </Card>\n    </section>\n  </div>;\n}\n"],"names":[],"mappings":";;;;;;AAAe,eAAe;kBAC5B,+YAAC;QACC,OAAM;QACN,OAAM;kBAEN,cAAA,+YAAC;YAAQ,OAAM;sBACb,cAAA,+YAAC;gBAAK,WAAU;0BACd,cAAA,+YAAC;oBAAY,WAAU;8BACrB,cAAA,+YAAC;wBAAI,OAAM;;0CACT,+YAAC;gCAAI,OAAM;0CACT,cAAA,+YAAC;oCACC,OAAM;oCACN,OAAM;oCACN,KAAI;oCACJ,KAAI;;;;;;;;;;;0CAIR,+YAAC;gCAAI,OAAM;0CACT,cAAA,+YAAC;oCAAI,OAAM;;sDACT,+YAAC;sDAAE;;;;;;sDAMH,+YAAC;sDAAE;;;;;;sDAQH,+YAAC;sDAAE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAcnB","debugId":null}}]
