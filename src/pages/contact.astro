      Let’s collaborate! I’d love to write music for your project. I am also available for instrumental work as a violinist - you can hear a sample of my work here. (Go to violin demo reel)
      
      When writing for games, my rate is typically determined on a per-minute basis, including implementation through FMOD or Wwise if desired. My rate is flexible, so please feel free to reach out directly and we can work out the specifics!
